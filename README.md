a game about a crash, a long-dead civilization, and you.


Translate the ancient runes you find around you all on your own!

"The Darksouls of Translating Simulators" - Me

Solve puzzles by translating text, or just rush through and make it all up as you go!


Do you have what it takes to translate an alien language, and escape? or will the same thing that ended this civilization, end you?
